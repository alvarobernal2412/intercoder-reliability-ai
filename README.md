# ðŸš€ LLM-Based Data Classification with Intercoder Reliability ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation that adapts the traditional **intercoder reliability** technique for use with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The project leverages the **Cohenâ€™s Kappa** coefficient to measure the agreement between the model and a human user during a calibration phase, with the goal of achieving consistent and reliable data classification.

## Key Features

- **Intercoder Reliability with LLM**: Utilizes the Cohenâ€™s Kappa coefficient to align an LLM with human-provided labels.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Allows for user interaction during the calibration process, where the user provides feedback on model errors.
- **Abstract Learning**: The LLM extracts general, abstract lessons from user feedback to avoid overfitting and improve future predictions.
- **LangGraph Integration**: Implements the workflow using LangGraph, a framework for orchestrating and managing AI workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Initial Prediction**: The LLM predicts labels for 20% of the dataset.
2. **Comparison & Calculation**: These predictions are compared with the user-provided labels, and the Cohenâ€™s Kappa coefficient is calculated.
3. **User Feedback**: If the Kappa coefficient is below 0.6, the user provides feedback on the incorrect predictions.
4. **Model Adjustment**: The model extracts lessons from this feedback and refines its predictions.
5. **Repetition**: Steps 1-4 are repeated until the Kappa coefficient exceeds 0.6.
6. **Final Prediction**: Once the threshold is met, the LLM labels the remaining 80% of the data.


### Example Data

The repository includes a small sample dataset for demonstration purposes.

## Limitations

This is a basic implementation designed to showcase the concept. The following areas may require further development:

- **Scalability**: Adjustments might be needed for larger datasets.
- **Model Customization**: The LLM's adaptability to different domains may vary.
- **Feedback Integration**: More sophisticated methods of feedback incorporation could enhance performance.
